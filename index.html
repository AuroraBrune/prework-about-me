      <h1>I'm learning software development to change careers and become a computer programmer.</h1>
      <p>I'm currently enrolled in KU bootcamp and hope to become a skilled software developer in this growing field. </p>
      <h1>I am originally from California and moved to Kansas with my husband. </h1>
      <p>We've lived in Kansas for almost 30 years and we raised our kids here.</p>
      <h1>I love spending time with my family, going on hikes and working outdoors. We do vegetable and flower gardening and invite many birds to our yard. </h1>
      <p>One of our hobbies is traveling and one goal is to see all 50 states. I have eight states left.</p>
      <h1>My dream job is to work for a great company as a programmer who might have the option to work at home occasionally.</h1>
      <p>I can work in the Kansas City and North East Kansas area for now. </p>
      <h1>I live in Eudora, KS. </h1>
      <p>A fun favorite way to spend time is following the KU Jayhawks men's basketball team.</p>
      <h1>I am interested in becoming a web developer because I am a problem solver and love puzzles. I'm a logical thinker and would like to move into a career that would tap into my skill set. </h1>
